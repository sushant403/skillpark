### Introduction Start
    Good Morning/Afternoon respected Supervisor and teachers hope you are doing absolutely well.
    
    We are here to proudly present what we have achieved over the course of this Semester and the project development.

**A Freelancers Platform** 
    
    Looking at the current scenerio and those "Work from home" vibes with adding Unemployement burden, we thought of a start, a start which would eradicate both the problems with just a single platform. 
    We created Skillpark.

**Skillpark**

    Skillpark is a freelancing platfrom which consists of two major User Types or roles. One is the Freelancers and the other is Client/Employer.
    Employers post the jobs online with the requirements and the budget alloted for that job.
    Freelancers then 'bids' in that job along with other freelancers with their proposal. 
    And If the client is satisfied with a certain freelancer among the bids, he/she hier them.
    Simple as that.

### Postdiction / Summary

    We believe this might be a good start, even for ourself to outcome the result of what can be done at such a small time frame and with limited knowledge. The increase in confidence would certainly add up to make us better at what we do.
    Definitely learnt a lot of things during the course of developement of this project.

**~~Thank You~~**
